# Sorting Algorithms

## Description
A project that implements different sorting algorithms in C# and uses them to sort an array of randomly generated numbers.

Each algorithm is timed and a summary is displayed after all sorting algorithms have completed sorting.

## Usage
At the command line type:

`SortingAlgorithms.exe <size_of_array>`

If the siz_of_array argument is not entered the array size defaults to 1000.
